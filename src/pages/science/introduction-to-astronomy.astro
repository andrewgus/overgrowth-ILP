			Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect.
			Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or
			test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about
			the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our
			work.

			“Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The
			simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every
			area, and the flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had
			any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, ‘Dammit, stop!’ I don’t
			know what Thompson’s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I
			find. We are the cause! We were not ready! We did not do our job. We were
			rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day,
			when in our hearts we knew it would take a miracle. We were pushing the
			schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.
		</p>
		<p>
			“From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: ‘Tough’
			and ‘Competent.’ Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or
			what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities.
			Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for.
			Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be
			found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be
			perfect.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first
			thing you will do there is to write ‘Tough and Competent’ on your
			blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room
			these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and
			Chaffee. These words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission
			Control.

			<h3>Next Up&hellip;</h3>
			<p>
				Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
				everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every
				human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
				joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
				economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
				every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
				every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,
				inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt
				politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and
				sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust
				suspended in a sunbeam.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
				rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in
				glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction
				of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of
				one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of
				some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they
				are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have
				some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point
				of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping
				cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint
				that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is
				nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could
				migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the
				Earth is where we make our stand.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
				experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
				human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
				underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and
				to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever
				known.
