	Within this toggleFeature function, I'm also determining the nextActiveFeature and using that to set the isLocked prop all sections based on that, to respond to users desires for what feature(s) are active or not. Parts 1 and 2 below should properly fit into this function. Parts 3 and 4 should fit into their own named computed values.

	How below should function:
	âœ… 1) nextActiveFeature must: 1) be a feature, 2) must be toggled on, 3) NOT be completed


	 2) If a feature is complete, it cannot be isLocked: true. It must be unlocked. 

	 	2b) The only exception to 1 being when, for example, feature B is completed while feature A (which is situated before feature B in the section stack) is turned off. Then, the user decides to go back and turn feature A on. Feature A is now on, and incomplete, which would mean that all features after it must be locked and hidden until it is complete. This MUST include feature B. However, once feature A is completed, feature B will already also be completed and the user can progress past both as they are now both completed and unlocked.


	3) filterForNav will only ever contain: 1) all static content or any completed features preceding nextActiveFeature, and 2) the nextActiveFeature (if it exists)


	4) filterForLocked will only ever contain: any static content or any feature (completed or not) that comes after the nextActiveFeature
