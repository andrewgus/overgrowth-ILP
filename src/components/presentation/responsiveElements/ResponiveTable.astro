// TODO: create a properly responsive table. two slots here. One named headers for thead. One named data for tbody. Need to account for when there are <th> inside the <tbody> and how to handle that. Also, props for layout options. col headings vs. row headings vs. col&row headings. Review "Responive Tables" section of "Resonisve Design and Zoom" Deque Uni course. Consider how I can dynamically add the data-header to a <td> based on user input for a <th>.
